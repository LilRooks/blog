I've been actually working on converting my infrastructure to code for a long time, and Ansible was my choice of tool. I dragged my feet for a lot of it, but eventually I got a somewhat working playbook that does a lot of what I need, at least the things that can be done with Podman.

Right now I've gotten a gitea and drone server running, which should also make posting and updating this blog a lot easier! Unfortunately I haven't sanitized the folder so i can't upload it to my gitea yet.
