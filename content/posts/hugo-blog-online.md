So I decided to start a blog. It's not a lot, but it sure took a lot of work to actually get up and running. 

At first I was recommended to use [Jekyll][jekyll] for my blog, and I learned quite a bit, and even made this blog ready to use in it, until I found that [Hugo][hugo] was another static site generator that existed, and was supposedly *faster*.

So in the end I just ended up making two blogs: one destined for the trash and one that you see now. Hugo felt a lot different and possibly more difficult to set up personally, but I enjoyed setting them up.

In any case, this blog is probably going to be more of a thought dump than anything, so don't expect much from it, lol.
