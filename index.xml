It&amp;rsquo;s not a lot, but it sure took a lot of work to actually get up and running.
At first I was recommended to use Jekyll for my blog, and I learned quite a bit, and even made this blog ready to use in it, until I found that Hugo was another static site generator that existed, and was supposedly faster.
So in the end I just ended up making two blogs: one destined for the trash and one that you see now.</description></item><item><title>about</title><link>https://lilrooks.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 13:52:22 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://lilrooks.github.io/about/</guid><description> info email github resume (coming soon!)</description></item></channel></rss>
